# 🚀 EngageMeter

## 🎯 Project Overview

**EngageMeter** is a modern event engagement platform designed to make every participant count! Whether it’s a hackathon, conference, or workshop, EngageMeter helps organizers truly understand and boost attendee involvement.

> **Problem:** Students attend events but don’t always engage meaningfully, and organizers don’t know who’s actually learning or interacting.
>
> **Solution:** EngageMeter tracks session attendance, poll/Q&A participation, and resource downloads. It uses a dynamic scoring model to visualize engagement for every user in a beautiful, animated dashboard.
